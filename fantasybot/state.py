"""Persistent agent state: team snapshot + task list.

Enables two things that make the agent feel human:
  1) Detect WHAT HAS CHANGED since the last connection (someone got signed away
     from you, your balance went up/down, money came in from a sale...).
  2) Keep a self-updating list of the week's pending items (you're missing a
     goalkeeper, you need to bid on X before the market closes...).

Stored in `.state/` (gitignored). No sensitive data.
